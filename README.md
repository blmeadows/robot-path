# Robot Path

### Problem:
- Given a 2D matrix of size N x M represented by an array of strings:
- A cleaning robot will clean one square at a time and will run indefinitely
- The robot can only take right turns at an obstacle or at the end of the matrix
- N and M are each [1..20]
- The top-left cell is empty
- Each cell will contain "." (empty) or "x" (obstacle)
- The robot will start facing the right direction
- The goal is to determine how many total squares will be cleaned and to focus on _correctness_ rather than efficiency
